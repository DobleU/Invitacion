This responsive Bootstrap 5 carousel displays multiple items per slide with smooth transitions, infinite looping, and mouse drag or button navigation. It dynamically adjusts between one (mobile) and three (desktop) visible items, features auto-advance with pause on interaction, and includes numbered labels for clarity. The design incorporates touch-friendly dragging, left/right keyboard controls, and a subtle hover zoom effect, all while maintaining optimal proportions through viewport-based height calculation.
